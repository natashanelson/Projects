{"project_name":"HotelBlockChain",
"project_blurb":"HotelBlockChain, built on Blockchain technology, 
 is a platform that allows international travelers
 to reliably transact with a wide variety of hotels all around the world via their direct booking 
 channels by buying hotels’ loyalty points on “as needed” basis,
 thus giving them access to the lowest prices and allowing them to use their local currency or a
 digital currency. HotelBlockChain will help hoteliers eliminate several “middle men” from this transaction, 
 increasing the power of their direct booking channels and leveraging their existing technologies.",
